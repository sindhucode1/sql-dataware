**Key Highlights:**

**Data Ingestion & Staging (Bronze Layer):** Loaded CRM and ERP data from CSV files into SQL Server using incremental loading techniques to ensure scalability and efficiency.

**Data Transformation (Silver Layer):** Performed data cleaning, standardization, normalization, and implemented derived columns. Applied incremental loading strategies and used truncate-and-insert methods where necessary to maintain data integrity.

**Data Modeling:** Developed star schema models with well-structured fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical workloads and performance.

**Analytics & Reporting (Gold Layer):** Created complex SQL queries to derive actionable business insights. Designed dashboards and reports to visualize key metrics and trends.

**Tools & Technologies:** SQL Server, SSMS, ETL concepts, Data Warehousing, Medallion Architecture, Star Schema.

This project showcases my ability to architect scalable data pipelines, apply advanced transformation logic, and deliver insights through robust reporting, all aligned with real-world enterprise data engineering standards.
